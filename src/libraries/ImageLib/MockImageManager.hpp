 * @brief Image input manager based in YARP
 *
 * ImageManager is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern">singleton text</a> (only
 * one instance of this object can exist, that is is shared by all the users). To use this
 * class, we first have to register the manager with the RegisterManager() method.
 * Then, we can get the reference to the MockImageManager with ImageManager::getImageManager(), using
 * the corresponding id and access the manager with that reference.
 *
 * Imnage events are broadcasted to the registered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern">listeners</a>,
 * along with the reference to the manager that triggered them to be able to access the image.
