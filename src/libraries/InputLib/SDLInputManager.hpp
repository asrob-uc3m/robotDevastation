 * @brief User input manager (keyboard, mouse, joysticks, etc) using SDL
 *
 * SDLInputManager is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern">singleton text</a> (only
 * one instance of this object can exist, that is is shared by all the users). To use this
 * class, we first get the reference to the InputManager with getInputManager() and then we
 * access the manager with that reference.
 *
 * When the program finishes, the SDLInputManager can be deallocated using destroyInputManager().
 *
 * SDLInputManager acts as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern">fa√ßade</a>, offering
 * a unified interface to the different managers for the mouse, keyboard, etc.
 *
 * Input events are broadcasted to the registered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern">listeners</a>,
 * along with the data relevant to the event triggered (i.e. what key was pressed).
 *
